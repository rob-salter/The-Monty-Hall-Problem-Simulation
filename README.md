# The-Monty-Hall-Problem-Simulation
As part of my MSc Decision Analysis and Data Science - Decision Theory course. I was required to provide alternative solutions to the famous Monty Hall Problem. One of the solutions was using a Simulation to demonstrate the superior strategy. The solution was to use Python to simulate the problem and Pandas/Seaborn to visualise the results.
